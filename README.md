# heart_graph

## What is the Heart Graph Project?

This C++ project displays a specific function in a graph. The function has a parameter a, which constantly increases and turns it into a heart shape over time. This is my nerd side trying to be romantic. 

## Project Plan

### Step 1: Define the problem
 - I want to surprize my special someone with something geeky!
 - I want a graph with a function that looks like a heart (when the parameters are right)

### Step 2: Requirements
 - I need to create the program before next time I see her (2 days)
 - I need to code a graph to display a function
 - I need to add an increasing parameter to map the function

### Step 3: Tools
 - Step 4: Problem breakdown
 - Create a graph
 - Create the function
 - Add an increasing (a) parameter
 - Add some text overlay to the graph (to say something sweet)




## How does it work?

## How can you run it yourself?

## Can you use it?

Yes - feel free to make use of this project. Or create your own with a more advanced library to make it look better (definitely let me know if you do!).

Use it to help you code your own - then surprize your Girlfriend! She will love it (if she is a geek like you and I). If she doesn't like it...well she is probably not the right girlfriend to have anyways.  :P
